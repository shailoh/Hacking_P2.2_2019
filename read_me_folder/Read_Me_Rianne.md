1.	Select a list of keywords / glossary about what hacking is/ can be
Changing – editing – breaking – updating – improving – exploring – computer – human body – systems 

2.	Write down a reflection paragraph on nthe observational tool exercises
During this lesson we received an interesting way of seeing. 

We all brought an inspection tool, for me this was my credit card. Because these cards always have the same dimensions and are recognizable as a scale model. We closed our eyes for ten minutes and felt the tool, we listened to the sound and in this way developed a different view of these products. I personally thought it was really crazy to feel and hear a creditcard with my eyes closed. But I noticed that I was thinking much more about the object, that was an interesting insight. Then we wrote two pieces of text, one from the debit card perspective and one from my own perspective.

My perspective
You feel weak, I know I can break you with little force. Yet I know that you have more power than anything else. You feel, look and sound smooth, as if you have everything under control, but your user tracks are clearly felt. Is that a good or a bad thing?

The cards perspective
She searches for me in the place where I feel safe. I’m here with everyone else, but I know I’m the one she wants. And I’m not gonna like this. She asked me to watch after her property, but she constantly askes me to geve away a small part of it.
But wait this is different, she as me in her hands for almost ten minutes now, and that’s weird. I have this feeling, that I finally feel exepted.

3.	Grow the keywords/ glossary about what Hacking is;
A different or alternative way of thinking – changing a part in a system – also updating, breaking, improving, exploring 

4.	Gather documentation on the two sessions with Shailon and Joana;
Anatomy, the structure of internal workings of something. When I saw this subject at first I wasn’t sure what this has to do with working. But during the theory lesson and also the lesson in the drawing station, I learned that hacking your body also can be a hacking. I think for myself that this is the most amazing way of hacking, beacause the human body is made for reasons and hacking something inbetween that system can influence so much more things in the daily lives of human beings.

Hacker; originally someone who makes furniture wih an axe.
My first thoughts about hackers are, computer nerds, people in dark rooms managing computer codes and stealing a lot of money. But in fact everybody can be a hacker in a way and everything can also be hacked. I thought it was super interesting when we talked about hacking systems in class. I never thought that everything is in a system, this opened my eyes. From then on I saw systems in nature, for exampje the leaves of trees, wich are there for a purpose and are part of a bigger system, the tree, wich is part of forest, wich is part of nature wich is part of the ecological system etc etc. I really think this a great insight wich will help me in my further life.

Next to theory we also did a small assignment. We had to find different kinds of systems and analize that. I choose the system of a soap dispenser. I think its interesting that I alwasys change my toothpaste and my soap by exident, this got me thinking about hacking this system. 

We also did a nice workshop at the drawing station where I learnd that zooming in and zooming out is very important. Its the power of 10. We also brought pictures of our own bodys to hack them. I cutted out all my wrekles because i always try to hide them and I want to change that because its my body and I have to be proud. So I all glued this wreckles onto my body as a juwerly pattern. I really liked the way of working with my hands and doing stuff instead of thinking and yes, overthinking. This is something I do a lot during my advertising major and at this day i got the insight that it can bring so much fun to acutually work with my hands.

5.	write a summary on the Hacking lecture by Florian Cramer;

Hacking is changing, upgrading and inventing, Florian says.
Also, hacking is an open acces, everybody can do it and a hacker can be anything.
When you are interested in a certain topic, that can be your hacking knowledge.
Its about having an eye for a situation and the willing to change that system.
Its all about thinking further and different than the system.
The most important question for me after this lecture was, ‘’how well do you have to know about the topic to be able to hack the system. Florian’s answer was that you have to learn by doing stuff. Its about questioning and not only by knowing. I really will take this advice and words to my further journey on this academy. I thought this lecture was super interesting and mindblowing.

6.	Write a summary on the exercise you devoloped at varia;
Unfortunately I could’nt be at Varia, I have talked with my group mates about what they did there and I thougth it was very interesting to hear that they hacked soup recipies. But my question was if this is hacking or just changing something, because when does hacking stop then? I think this question is personal and different for everybody and maybe that is the nicest thing about hacking.

7.	revise all the topics above and reflect on the possible meaning of 'Hacking' (Respond to the questions: What is the context in which you operated? What phygical systems did you investigate? What did you find? What is your hacking method? If your method is a tool set, how would you explain to someone else how to use it? In what way are these tools limited/biased?);

Hacking is personal, I think for myself that that is my question about what hacking is.
Every person has an another perspective and that makes the world various and amazing. In this case I thought it was a bit hard to work together with different kinds of people, who all have other meanings and perspectives on what hacking is. So what we dit was discussing our vieuws on hacking. And what we acutually did was creating a critical statement about hacking inventions. For myself I really think a hacking invention can’t be a solution for everybody so it is very personal. And also some things are just okay the way they are. When you just start thinking about hacking everything, you just cant stop anymore. So what we did with our group was all thinking about things in our morning routing we think are not going well or are stupid, for me for example, brushing my teeth, I often put soap instead of toothpaste on my toothbrush, and I can tell you, that’s discusting.

Then we discussed the tree most nice/stupid hacks we came up with. The first is a bed wich throws you out in the morning, the second is a tool wich makes your breakfast in the morning and the third is my hack, filling a soap dispenser with toothpaste so you cant go wrong anymore. Our plan for our project was to make a small cocmmercial about a man who has invented these hacks and shows them to the vieuwer, but you see that he has troubles with it and it does not work as he want. We are going to make this with drawings and wrote a story board.

We called it ‘Henry’s Hacks’

Script:
Sleeping in bed, alarm rings, pushed out of bed, lays on the floor.
He gets up and goes to kitchen, bread hack, brusses teeth, hack with toothpaste soap. Preapare to leave, out the door, leaves and forgot keys, end.

Scene 1
(Opens with Henry asleep in bed)
This is Hendry. Last year he had a messy morning routine. Everything changed when he hacked it this year. Let’s take a look at how Henry is doing now. 
(Alarm rings and Henry is dumped on the floor) (music cuts and Henry isn’t moving)
Henry? You doing alright?

Scene 2
(Henry gets up, walks into kitchen) (music returns)
Ahh he’s doing fine, off to breakfast now where he shows us his hack for a quick and easy breakfast. (Bread hack, gets messy) 
Henry you should probably clean that out..
(Henry eats, music cuts)

Scene 3
You gotta get going Henry, time to brush your teeth.
(Henry goes to brush teeth, shown soap/toothpaste dispenser)
That’s a nice hack, but how do you wash your hands then? (hanry looks to camera annoyed)

Scene 4
(Henry gets a backpack and heads to this door)
How Henry is ready for the day, he has the perfect morning routine, nothing can go wrong anymore.
(Henry closes the door behind him and realised the keys are inside)
Oh well.. keep on hacking Hanry.
A small recap:

why this method?
  - an easy way to show multiple hacks at once
  - helped show the bigger structure of the morning routine/process
  - focusing more on the critical statement than the actual hacks
  - narratives/storytelling is an effective way to get a message across
  - henry is like the combination of all of us, and our morning stuggles
  - the hacks are supposed to be efficient, but its also good to not rush things
  - critical statement, hacking can be good and bad, even if henry is fast and efficient he's not foolproof, hacking can be personal

I thought this hacking course was very interesting. The filisofical thinking behind hacking is super cool and it has teached me to look futher than my normal mind does. Also the way we did this project was very interesting for me, I have never worked with animation or script writing before and therefore I learnd so much new stuff wich im taking further on my journey.
