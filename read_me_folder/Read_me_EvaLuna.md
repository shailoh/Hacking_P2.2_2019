# Documenting my hacking expierence


# Keywords to describe hacking:

- Coding
- experiments
- changing a system
- loopholes
- lifehacks
- hacking yourself. You can hack your own feelings and emotions by listening to music or eating something etc. But you could also hack your motivation by watching a ted talk.
- performence, like a flashmob
- medicine

As soon as it becomes commercialised, it’s not a hack anymore. At least that how Shailoh interpreters it. I think this is very interesting. A hack is not just a solution to something, but also unconventional. 

# The sessions with Shailoh and Joana

In the first session we had with Shailoh and Joana we firstly introduced ourselves and talked about how we were already familiar with hacking and what hacking meant to us. This was quite interesting because already i heard a lot of different experiences and ideas. To some people hacking meant coding for the biggest part. To there people hacking was way bigger than that. A big could even be a hack to make someone feel better, so to speak. It was clear that the lines to what hacking was and is were still very vague to me at that point. After the presentations of Shailoh and Joana about what they do as hackers, it became a little clearer to me what possibilities were. It wasn't until the second session, when the man from the research station came to give us a presentation about the history of hacking, that the concept of hacking was more accessible to me. I understood now that you don’t have to be a technical owner to hack something, you just have to be able to look at things differently. 
After the presentation we could immediately use this new knowledge in the observational tool exercise. 

# Hacking with Florian Cramer

This class, we got a bit of a history lesson about hacking. This was very usefull and interesting in the sense that we were handed dozens of examples of hacking. This showed me that there are a lot of different ways people hack. It can be a social movement or even a subculture but it can also be a political statement etc. The main idea is that you take a system and don't look at the limitations. You twist it and turn it untill the outcome or the purpose is changed.

Some notes of hacks i found especially interesting:
- Cap 'n crunch, John Draper (flute in cornflakes for free phonecalls)
- Blueboxes
- the yes men
- ubu.com
- Blackhead or whitehead hacker system
- 1960s counterculture

# Observational tool exercise

For the observational tool exercise we had to take an inspection tool with us. I took a knife with me. During class we had to observe the tools for about 15 minutes. At some point we had to close our eyes and just feel the tools. While touching my knife i felt every detail and realised what other things you could do with a knife beside just cutting stuff. This was probably the point of the exercise as hacking is al about using a system or tool in a different way. It was quite insightful to realise this first hand during a more simple exercise than having it explained in a presentation with lots of examples. Afterwards we had to write about how the object would feel. I decided to write about what the knife feels like and how people don't see its full potential.

How the Knife feels:

I’m stuck. I'm litterally stuck. Just a moment ago someone decided to stick me into a piece of butter and leave me here. I can’t move on my own, you know? I rely on you to make the right decisions for me. I trust you. And yet here you are, sticking me into random foods again and again. Don’t you see my potential? I’m so much more that something that can slice through stuff. I don’t just want to destroy. 
Put me in some ink and use me as a pen, I could create the most beautiful poetry for you. Pollish me and use me as a mirror, i’ll show you a mesmerising reflection. Hell throw me into a dartboard, i can be an entertainer. I can be any of these things for you but please, just take me out of this butter. It’s humiliating.

# Anatomical drawing
We hacked into our own bodies by cutting into life size pictures of ourselves. This was an interesting way to start being creative with the concept of hacking. What i took out of this is that there's always ways to look at things differently and to hack into them by changing things up. Even in the things that seem realy set, like your own body. 

The teacher also told us about Chindogu. It's a japanese movement of all sorts of small hacks that look ridicilous that are usefull but also useless. It's become a culture and an attitude in japan to create these small little hacks. In the west a lot of people see these hacks and think they are serious about them.

# Hacking at Varia
Also here, we were experimenting in a fun way to see what the different posibilities are with hacking. this time we hacked not our own body, but a soop recipy. To me, in this class i was starting to see more context attached to hacking. Where the first class was mostly about experimenting and trying to see things in another light, this class was more about purpose. The purpose of this class was more about being aware of why you are hacking something. In this case it was about being more conciderate with the materials and ingredients you use. In this class i started understanding better what the purpose of hacking can be in a way that i find it interesting. 

Also this way of hacking is something i would like to try to use in my own work and movies. A question i thought about was, what is the most conciderate way to make a movie. With this question there is so much to think about. for example:

- Where do you put the money, into big companies/smaller companies?
- Who from the crew gets a say in what aspect of the movie
- What about the cast?
- What materials do you use?
