Differences between ‘making’ and ‘hacking’
You make something that doesn’t exist yet, but when you hack you change something that’s already there. But are we really making new things? We make things with the tools and things that are there already… so do we make or hack?

| To make: | To hack: | 
| --- | --- | 
| -	Assemble | -	Break into something
| -	Create               | -	Ways to understand
| -	Put things together  | -	Joke / prank

    “The creation of new and useful knowledge is innovation. [...] Knowledge - the output of human innovation -
    is unique amoung all other resources.   
    It's not a physical resource. [...] A wheel may break or wear out, but the idea of the wheel 
    will keep on working.” 
    -Ramez Naam, 2013
