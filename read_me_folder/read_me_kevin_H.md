**2. write down a reflection paragraph on the observational tool exercises (tip: you can link to images/ drawings);**

Circle maker
[https://www.google.com/search?q=sirkel+cutter+tool&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiorp_Ix7HiAhXFDuwKHQPuC_4Q_AUIDigB&biw=1863&bih=950#imgrc=E3_KjU5TwkNU4M:]
The tool viewpoint:
{ Iam extendable, with a click my right arm is relocated over a part of my body }
{ Iam stiff but exact. I Turn around and make beautiful circles, drawing or cutout }
{ No other shape. I have an extension where people can hold grip}                      
{ I have a secret little area were i hold my knifes and charcoal. Iam mostly not used, just for special occasions}
{People don't need a lot of circles in their life, takes to much effort i guess. Iam seen often as a ruler, or measure tool. 
I Am not, i am an tool of art. Of perfection.}

                                 >>>>     [https://imgur.com/gallery/tcM8IsL]    <<<<
                                 
{I'm too perfect, that means not a lot of others can relate to me}
{I am just able to do one think, which i am really good at and others love me for that}
{I Am easily adjustable, able to bend to someone's wishes to create the circle they like} 
{I sometimes am closed of, living in my small circle, but sometimes i draw huge to express} 
{my joy, and in the end i embody them all because they are the expression from what iam}
{Iam square but make the opposite.}





Reflection:
- The blinking helped me see how the object itself its an contradictonairy from what it is used for (square and circles)
- By feeling the object, i didn’t really learn anything other then that the point is pretty sharp.
- The object itself is an interesting object because of its perfection and acuaray as a tool, making such perfect circles, 
but makes it an unrelatable object.


Weegschaal.

{People stand on me and i'm sick of it}
{I make people unhappy, make them feel fat}
{I also make people more healthy and i'm necessary to tell that message}
{I Am a scale of healthiness and a tool to fool people}
{Iam digital and practical}

interesting how the light reflects differently from it.
Its an heavy object itself, an i never thought about how i was feeling the weight of a weighting tool. 
It's an interesting tool to speculate about
The weighting tool is actually pretty sad if you think about it. 

Why did you bring your tool?
        - It's a 2 way use of information → making circles and measuring circles 

What are the differences between your tools?
The obvious differences were that the weighting tool records Kilograms and the circle tool records length.
But the big difference is that the circle tool also creates, and the weighting tool can’t do that, it is simply there to record. 

REFLECTION ON THIS EXERCISE:

This exercise sure was interesting, the way we looked at an object in a different way by blinking really fast or just feeling 
it with our eyes closed gave me a feeling of mindfulness. The way you focus on a object can erase all the worries out of you head 
and really connect with that mysterious tool in your hand. Because of this the exercise where we had to think for the object 
and create thoughts and memories for it was way more easy because you got to know the object before hand.
At first i thought what i was doing was ridiculous, but gradually i understood what the value was. 

I also see how this reflects back on the experiment with the door. How can an door be used in other ways?
Everyone has a different way to open a door, a system that works for them. Do we also all see objects differently?
Do we feel different and can we use this to our advantage by hacking it. 
Hack the senses, let people feel what you feel or experience something completely different. 
I love this philosophical, scientific way of looking at the world.
You analyze but then see how you can turn it into another system. 
There is a lot of fantasy and hypothesizing in this. This practise has me interested.. 

Grow the keywords/ glossary about what Hacking is (tip: add your own references);
Hacking is interrupting a (dynamic) system in a way that it was not meant too. Interrupting can be disrupting the system, 
gathering information from it, re laying its roots and adding to it. Its manipulating a system where either its dynamic
input and output change, or by destroying it you discontinue the flow to the output, resulting in that another systems is 
affected by that. If you cut off the flow of water to a village, that village system is affected by it and will change its roots. 
As Shailoh said, a system is constantly leaking energy, they are alive. They can be expanded and manipulated, the boundaries 
can be pushed. 
to observe
to feel 
interact
change
to cut with heavy blows in an irregular or random fashion
to confuse
to cope 
to accept 
traffic
secure and insecure 
to re-define
to eliminate 
In the documentary: “The search for sugar man”, a man named  Malik Bendjelloul went on looking 
for a unlikely superstar Rodriguez, a man that only became famous in a small part of the world,
 but never got global fame and was forgotten in time. Malik went searching for him, but after months of no results, 
the film company backing him took away all his film equipment and he had to rely on his iphone.  
He hacked his way through this documentary, filming with a vintage filter to record the remaining film he needed.
                         

It shows that being Limited tends to make you creative. For him, his system was Eliminated to only his iphone.

Critical making:
combining critical theory and creating classes.
Tools for action.

Ants can follow each other and get stuck in a loop forever until death.
Humans are not that different.

Choreography has become a metaphor for dynamic constellations of any kind of consciously choreographed or not, 
self-organizing or artificially constructed. If the world is approached as a reality constructed of interactions,
 relationships, constellations and proportionalities and choreography is seen as the aesthetic practise of setting 
those relations or seeing the conditions for those. 

Choreography isn’t just freedom of the body, its also limiting yourself to force your body to move a certain way.

After reading the manifesto we had been given, we came to the conclusion that these 5 words:
xenofemenism
{The idea of a new wave of feminism, with its secret tool to use technology and science to base its views and values on.}
naturalism
{A naturalistic way of thinking is based on the facts and logic that comes with our biology and nature that surounds us.}
emancipation
{Gaining cetrain political rights and power} 
technoscience
{We humans are constantly striving for technical innovation. Technoscience is the process and result of these innovations}
patriarchy
{The idea that the world is led by man.}

(lesson 2)
Modes of inspection: observing, noticing and intervening:
To see- three dimensional world through the eyes
To look begin to notice phenomena, and distinguish between them.
To watch - The brains begin to organize one's sight
To observe - the ultimate level, intelligens, an ordered and lucid internal knowledge.
To view - On the other hand, is a way of looking that involves a threat, expectation.

WHAT IF YOU WOULD INSPECT WITH OTHER SENSES? WHAT IF THE EYES ARE DISTRIBUTED  AND ALL SENSES COME BACK TO TOUCH?

Affordance → all action possibilities depending on users physical capabilities.
            A glass of water is different where its in its liquid state or vaporized state.
Different objects are able to interact different with then was internatily intended to be used. 
Manipulate behaviour of people that can only use objects one way.
An objects affordances depend on users physical capabilities and their goals and past experiences. A chair only affords sitting,
because past experience supports that action.

→ So how can i as an artist look at different objects and human behaviour and try to make a new system or hack that system out of 
those 2 elements. 

Affordance it's neither an objective property, nor a subjective property or its both if you like.
An affordance cuts across the dichotomy of subjective objective and helps us to understand its inadequacy. 
It is equally a fact of the environment and a fact of behavior. An affordance points both ways, to the environment and to the observer.

INTERFACES:

You have different interfaces on multiple levels.
- meaning you can interact differently with a system depending what kind of object you influence.   
(killing a bee kills just one bee but destroying the hive has way more of an impact)  
Interface as an “onion”: "The interface is an "agitation" or generative friction between different formats. In computer science, 
this happens very literally; an "interface" is the name given to the way in which one glob of code can interact with another.
 Since any given format finds its identity merely in the fact that it is a container for another format, the concept of interface 
and medium quickly collapse into one and the same thing    

Last lesson:
Does hacking need to have a purpose
    -  just adjusting something isn’t necessary hacking
What does hacking mean to me?
Hacking for me was always the computer hacking we know out of series and all that kind of good stuff. It was a tool to get information,
get access to something or to disrupt something.



**=Hacking for me =**
I have been thinking about how hacking comes back in my own life and how it affects me.
Its funny to look at your body in that way, especially in the lesson where we had to rearrange our body parts and hack your body
structure. So many possibilites. It reminds me of the doctor who altered the genes of babies so that they were HIV immune. 
That doctor is in hiding right now because his practise was illigal, but that's what hacking about, pushing boundaries. 
I also in my field like to practise hacking. I love hacking reality, in the visual way. I am pretty good at making AR but also VR work.
I hack reality by creating an altering space in the virual world where people can live in, but i can also make a fake animation 
layer over taped reality where video and animation collide and create an alternate reality. The input is the view of what people see 
and their reaction is the output. That is the social system, but iam also hacking the biological system, the eyes are deceived and 
think fake images are real. And at last we have the technical system, i literally have to hack my OCULUS GO to get to be able to work 
on it. Only real professional get to work on the OCULUS GO but there is a way to hack around that and be able to upload your files onto
it. Virtual reality is a powerful hacking tool, but it has its huge technical limitations that can’t just be adjusted. 
Still Oculus is busy hacking its own systems and pushing boundaries to make their product cheaper and easier to handle. 
             
**S/yste/ms and S.C/.A__.M.P.E.R**

We have to walk around the school and find hidden systems that can be manipulated. After some searching I couln't find anything good 
and stared out of the window. Then I noticed all the other windows and how they control the flow of light. I took all the windows 
as my system. 

Using the scamper method, you can influence a system. 
- THe world can be totaly differnt, what was once functional in the past, doesnt have to be anymore.

Systems leak energy and are on every scale, interacting with eachother.

**5. write a summary on the Hacking lecture by Florian Cramer;**

In florians lecture we: 
- what a hacker is:
            Hacking is finding something in a system that its not suppose to do.
            Hacking is a way of rebellious activism
            Blackhead hacker: griefing
            Whitehead hacker: constructive hacker culture 
- looked at influencel people in the hacking world and how they practise hacking like:
            Rop Gongrijp   (hacking network lines to give everyone acces)
            Cornelia Solfrank (intervention at Chaos Computer Club)
            Capʼn crunch (Hacked the phone counter, in that way the whistle allowed free calling)
- Looked at how hacking influenced the future:
            Taping music kills the music industry, piratebay stole their logo
            Bitcoin came from hacker culture 
- Looked at different sites that we can use to acces cetrain libraries
            www.ubu.com/sounds      
            www.aaargh.fail
            karagarga: all shortfilms

In short, we got a lot of examples what kind of people and organisations applied hacks in their surroundings to push boundaries.
These hacks most of the time influenced the future, by getting attention or changes whole systems around. Hacking is a way to 
tell a message and influence the social culture we live in right now. Look out of the box and see what's beyond just the system 
you are forced too agree with. 
            
**6. At Varia we were introduced to the phenomenon Food Hacking.**

Varia members Niek and Lidia inspect this type of hacking and gave a lecture about it.

Foodhacking: 
          - make a receipe more accesable to create 
If someone has a allergy for an ingridient in your pumkin pie, how do you create a pumkin pie without that ingredient?
Another example, how can you make a recipe vegan friendly or eco-friendly?

When hacking food you have to think about:
- what party do i want to aid
- consumer, producer, enviroment, primary sector or wellbeing of animals?
- what is the origin of your ingredient

We had to put all our ingredients into one pan, and create a hacked soup. It didnt really have anything special for me. 
It didnt really feel as hacking. Altough it was interesting. It does not qualify as a hack. What boundries am i pushing here? 
Iam not changing anything or changing any systems, just making some disgusting soup.
A better idea would be like how do i make somehting that tastes like this, but instead uses different ingriedents to get that tastes.
Just like meat replacements arent meat but infact are other ingriedents tasing like meat. It would have been fun to give us an objective kind of food that we had to recreate with other ingriedents. That is hacking.
        


**7. revise all the topics above and reflect on the possible meaning of 'Hacking'**
Respond to the questions:

**What is the context in which you operated?**

We tried to criticize the way drugs is not allowed to openly take with you into a party, but when your inside it is acknowledged and 
sometimes even made profit on by selling popsicles. 

 **What physical systems did you investigate?**
 
We investigated how far we could push the openness in witch you can show drugs on your body when your being searched by the guards. 

**What did you find?**

We found that guards don’t look at the obvious. They are oblivious to what is in plain sight. 

**What is your hacking method?**
Make jewelry where drugs is attached too, but dont hide it. This way the gaurds won’t notice it because they dont see the obvious. 
This way you dont have to hide it in your pants or bra. Its Reversing the system. 

**If your method is a tool set, how would you explain to someone else how to use it?**
Go to a cheap store like the sow low and buy cheap jewelery and clips.      
Use ironwire and the clips to create rings, necleses and earrings.  >>> https://imgur.com/gallery/P5RHOxs <<<
Take the preferred drugs and clip it in your jewelery.              >>> https://imgur.com/cGvJw0S <<<
Go to the party and don’t draw any attention to your jewelry when your getting searched. >>>  https://imgur.com/ya0kEcc  <<<
When inside, pop the drugs out and enjoy!                           >>> https://imgur.com/BpD2Q37 <<<

**In what way are these tools limited/b**

They is of course still a chance of being caught. Also the jewelry becomes pretty big and. Besides that makes rain your biggest enemy 
if your wearing pills out. The whole idea was to give critisism on the way drugs is handled right now. 
Its pretty mutch garanteed that drugs is brought in into a club and is even acknowledged by selling supportive aids to help 
people who are to far on drugs. Most of the clubs profit from it, but when they find out that you have it you get punished badly for 
it and even can get police involvement. We want to re open that debate about drugs and how the system around regulation is not perfect 
at all. 

The definition of hacking has changed a lot for me. This course has been very informative. I like how we really got to practise
the theory around hacking. I am aplying this in my future projects, using SCAMPER for an easy way of aplying my knowledge.
Hacking is all about looking at your enviroment and see how you can influence systems. See futher then just one object and see
that everything is connected. A hacker is someone who pushes boundries, someone who invents and alters its suroundings.
